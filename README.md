# n_puzzle

## mandatory

-   [x] You must provide a Makefile with the usual rules.
-   [x] Implement the A\* search algorithm (or one of its variants, youâ€™re free to choose) to solve an N-puzzle
-   [ ] You have to manage various puzzle sizes (3, 4, 5, 17, etc ...). The higher your program can go without dying a horrible, horrible death, the better.
-   [ ] You have to manage both randomly determined states (of your own generation of course), and input files that specify a starting board, the format of which is described in the appendix.
-   [x] The cost associated with each transition is always 1.
-   [x] The user must be able to choose between at LEAST 3 (relevant) heuristic functions. The Manhattan-distance heuristic is mandatory, the other two are up to you.
-   [ ] Show total number of states ever selected in the "opened" set (complexity in time)
-   [ ] Show maximum number of states ever represented in memory at the same time during the search (complexity in size)
-   [ ] Show number of moves required to transition from the initial state to the final state, according to the search
-   [x] Show the ordered sequence of states that make up the solution, according to the search
-   [x] The puzzle may be unsolvable, in which case you have to inform the user and exit

## bonus

-   [x] Configure g(x) and h(x) to run both the uniform-cost and greedy searches
-   [x] Visualizer
-   [ ] Rectangles from_file, solvable and unsolvable files
-   [ ] Normal and Snail mode
